### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Python Exercise

### Description
This project is built using Python and helps analyse a large dataset of bike sharing data, split among 3 cities (NY, CHI, WA). The program is built so that it presents a step by step menu for the user to choose which segment of the dataset they want to get descriptive statistics on. The requirements are presented below:

  #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    - most common month
    - most common day of week
    - most common hour of day

  #2 Popular stations and trip
    - most common start station
    - most common end station
    - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

  #3 Trip duration
    - total travel time
    - average travel time

  #4 User info
  - counts of each user type
